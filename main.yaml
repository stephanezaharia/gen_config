# YAML: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html
# Describes all parameters used in our applicatin groups by features
# Each new parameter added during development phase must be added in this file
# A parameter can belong to several features

# Versionning: this file is backward compatible. It means that no parameter can be removed
# but a parameter can be marked as deprecated
# Assumption for targeted applications: 
# * All configuration files generated are in XML format
# * Any parameter not used by the application but present in configuration file is ignored and does not cause any malfunction

# A tool gen_conf can then use this yaml to generate exhaustive configuration files
# The tool can also later validate an existing configuration

# A parameter as name (usually the last key used in the configuration file)
# A path composed with file.section.parameter (XML path is separated by dot)
# A value ...
# A comment that can be used later to generate automatic documentation
# A parameter name and a parameter path should NOT contain any DOT

# Only business parameter not related to topology of the installation are added here. 
# Example 
#  * nb_max_order_in_book should appear in this file
#  * list_port: 5600 should NOT appear in this file

# Command line should be something like:
# qf_gen_config generate --core --market_making --prefix SWED --out .

# Limitations:
# New files are always generated. Existing file will be overwriten
